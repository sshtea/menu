This is a team project consisting of Alexander Goldberg, Safa Asadi, Konstantin Keller and Brett Goldfine

For this project we are building an interactive restaurant menu in which a user can create their own distinct order for a
restaurant and save this order for future references. This will inable a user to order from the menu and "Purchase" the items
from the menu. This will then be saved into a database for the user to access at any time to "ReOrder" their past purchases as
a customer will usually order their typical favorites from their usual restaurants. The customer will have a list to choose
from and select the items, once the customer has completed their selections, the customer can hit purchase and this will
automatically save their selections into the database along with other users entries. This can also permit customers to select
other peoples order entries as well if they will like to try someone elses order.
